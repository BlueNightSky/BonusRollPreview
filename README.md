# BonusRollPreview

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bonusrollpreview) or at [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info22213).

## Description

BonusRollPreview allows you to see at a blance what the possible yields from a bonus roll would be.  
When the bonus roll window shows up, press the arrow button to show a quick preview of items.  
You can also change your spec priority right from the window, see the button in the top left corner.

So, from now on you don't have to alt-tab to a browser or open the Encounter Journal while on limited time.

This addon was made based on an idea posted on [reddit](//reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1b79zj/addon_idea_after_you_killed_a_boss_you_will_see_a/).
